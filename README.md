# Research Project Repository – s49072239

## Overview
This repository is created as part of REIT6811 Tutorial 6 – Data Handling and GitHub Practice.  
It includes my student folder `s49072239_folder_name_as_per_tutorial`, which contains research data, scripts, and documents.  
The aim is to demonstrate good practices in organising files, using GitHub for version control, and collaborating effectively.

## Collaboration Guidelines
1. Work on a separate branch for new features or updates.  
2. Use meaningful and descriptive commit messages.  
3. Submit a Pull Request (PR) before merging into `main`.  
4. Follow the agreed file/folder naming conventions.  
5. Keep this README and related documentation up to date.
