# Student Folder (Tutorial 6)
Put your work here (de-identified data only).

## Structure
1_Literature_Review/ — PDFs, notes  
2_Quantitative_Analysis/ — survey (de-ID), scripts, outputs  
3_Qualitative_Analysis/ — transcripts (de-ID), codes, memos  
4_Drafts_And_Reports/ — proposals, drafts, final  
5_Additional_Materials/ — photos, consent templates, info sheets

> Git does not track empty folders, so `.keep` files are placeholders.
